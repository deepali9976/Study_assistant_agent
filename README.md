Study Assistant: A Tool-Augmented AI Agent for Smarter Learning

The Study Assistant Agent is a single, intelligent AI agent built with FastAPI, Phidata, and LLMs, designed to help students understand and retain information more effectively.
Equipped with a suite of specialized tools, this agent can:

📄 Read and extract text from academic PDFs
✨ Summarize content using advanced language models
🔍 Search the web and YouTube for relevant educational resources
📝 Generate structured study notes
❓ Answer user questions by grounding answers in both the uploaded PDF and external sources
🧠 Remember user inputs (like name, previous pdfs) to personalize future suggestions


Rather than a multi-agent system, this project uses one central agent that orchestrates multiple capabilities through tool-based interactions — a lightweight and modular design inspired by modern AI agent frameworks.
This approach makes it ideal for extending, debugging, and personalizing the assistant — all while keeping the system simple, efficient, and user-friendly.
